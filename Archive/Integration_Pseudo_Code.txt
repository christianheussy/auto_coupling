Initialization PseudoCode


Start Up Code (Alex and Austin)
* Microcontroller starts when it has power (truck starts)
* Run script which launches executable 
* Wait for keypad input to begin


Initialize System upon Keypad Input (Pauline and Kirstin)
* Launch CAN threads
* Need textbox to display commands to driver
   1. Select trailer using arrow key input
   2. Press and hold brake pedal
   3. Shift into drive
   Check pedal and gear
   Set autopark enable true
   Check autopark enable


Camera vs.LIDAR Priority and Path (Camera and LIDAR teams)
* Run in parallel with initialization
* Save user point, user for comparison with Camera
* Check that LIDAR agrees with Camera
* Check that trailer within 20m
* If selection outside LIDAR view, continue without LIDAR check until trailer within LIDAR
* Compute path, check if path is possible


        If error:
        If point out of range prompt driver to move closer and try again (why not use system to drive closer?)
        If path not possible, prompt driver to reposition and try again


        Note: Need to figure out what to do if LIDAR does not agree with camera


Main Loop (everyone)

        Steering (Christian)
Apply torque based on error between desired and current tractor slope 


        Lower LIDAR safety check (Caroline)
* Look for closest object in view
* Average readings
* If something closer than trailer stop


        Lower LIDAR looking for King Pin (Caroline)
* Use path algorithm to make final correction
* Exit loop after alignement, travel straight backwards


        Lower LIDAR height detection (Caroline and Austin)
* Pass to suspension


        Cartesian Coordinates
* Read theta1, theta2, and distance (compare camera and LIDAR values). Convert to two points that represent tractor as straight line using known tractor length.


Coupling (CAN and LIDAR)
* Check for fifth wheel lock
* Check for sudden deceleration
* Check distance upper LIDAR (maybe camera) and trailer face
* Check if we have reached end of new calculated path
If true Trigger brakes
